    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy lasagne recipe filled with mediterranean vegetables. Great comfort food for those long winter nights. You can either eat it on its own or eat with some garlic bread for some extra Italian feeling. Serves 2-4 people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250g of lean mince</li>
        <li>2 peppers</li>
        <li>1 courgette</li>
        <li>1 leek</li>
        <li>500g passata</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>150g lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>1 packet of white sauce mix</li>
        <li>350ml of skimmed milk</li>
        <li>80g of reduced fat cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees C and coat a pan or wok with oil and place on a medium heat</li>
        <li>Crush the garlic and add it to the pan with mince. Cook until it just starts turning brown.</li>
        <li>Chop the leek, pepper and courgette into small chunks or slices and add this to the pan cooking until they start turning soft.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down low and add the ground cumin, passata and salt and pepper, allowing it to simmer until all the vegetables are very soft and stir occasionally to infuse the cumin with the passata.</li>
        <li>Make the white sauce mix, as per the instructions on the packet using the skimmed milk.</li>
        <li>In a deep dish, make the lasagne by creating layers of the simmered mince, followed by the lasagne sheets and then a thin layer of the white sauce.</li>
        <li>Keep building these layers, until you run out of mix and then grate the cheddar cheese and sprinkle it on top of the top layer of white sauce.</li>
        <li>Put it in the oven for 40 mins covered with foil. After the time, remove the foil and return to the oven for another 15 mins or until the cheese has melted and started to turn brown.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
